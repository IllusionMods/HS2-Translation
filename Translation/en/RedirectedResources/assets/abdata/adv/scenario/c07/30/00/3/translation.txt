//attitude:neutral
ん？　なんだそれは……オレを馬鹿にしてんのか？=I honestly don't know what you mean by that, could you start over?
何を遠慮してんだ？　よく分かんねぇやつだな。=That's great and all, but I mean... Come on, really? How do I even respond to that?
//attitude:favor
オレをおちょくりに来たのか？　あんま舐めてると、オマエでもぶっ飛ばすぞ？=Did you come over here just to mess with me? Did you think I'd fall for that one again?
なんだかよくわからねーが。何でもねぇって言うなら、もうお開きだな。=We'll come back to this one another time, it's a bit beyond me right now.
//attitude:enjoyment
なんだ？　用が無いなら、最初からオレに構うな。=I wish you'd think about things before you say them to me sometimes.
思わせぶりな態度をしてるつもりか？　オレには何にも伝わってねぇぞ？=Look, it's not you, I'm just not having a good day, the smallest things are upsetting me.
//attitude:aversion
あ？　とことん意味不明なやつだな。用が無いなら、オレの視界に入ってくんな。=If you say something stupid to me like that again then you'll have to suck your own dick in future, because I'll be done.
クソが。オマエはオレをイラつかせるのが本当に上手いな。=Ugh. You really know how to piss a girl off. You know that, right?
//attitude:slavery
ほう、オレは試されてるのか？　なぁ、どうなんだ？=Wait. Is this a trick question? Can't you just say what you mean outright?
つまり、オレから誘われるのを期待してるのか？　そんな受け身なやつには、かける言葉はねぇな。=I think I get what you're saying, but I think we'll have to leave it for another day...
