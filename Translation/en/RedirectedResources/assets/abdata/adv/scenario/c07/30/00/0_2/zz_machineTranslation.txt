こんなところで会うなんて。オマエ、絶対覗き目的だろ？=I can't believe I'm meeting you here. You're definitely a peeping tom, aren't you?
おい、覗きはバレないようにしろよ？=Hey, you don't want to get caught peeking, do you?
で？　何かオレに用があるなら、早く言え。=So? If you need me for something, just tell me.
オレに話があんのか？　手短にしろよ？=You want to talk to me? Can we make this quick?
オマエも風呂か？　汚ぇ体をきちんと洗っとけよ？=Are you taking a bath, too? Make sure you wash your filthy body properly, okay?
身体は綺麗にしとけよ。臭ぇやつは嫌われるぞ？=You should keep your body clean. People don't like smelly people, okay?
ん？　なんだ？　ジッと見てねぇで、言いたいことがあるならハッキリ言え。=Hmm? What is it? Don't just stare at me. If you have something to say, say it clearly.
ほら、何か言え。オレに用があんだろ？=Come on, say something. You wanted to see me, right?
なんだ、オレを覗きに来たのか？　この変態め。=What, are you here to spy on me? You pervert.
覗きで掴まる前に、正直に言ってみたらどうだ？　裸を見せてくださいってな。=Before you get grabbed by a peeping tom, why don't you be honest with him? Ask to see me naked.
まさか、ガン付けに来たわけじゃないだろ？　要件はなんだ？=You're not here to shoot me, are you? What's the requirement?
用が無いなら俺は行くぞ？　時間は有限ってやつだ。=If you don't need me, I'll go. Time is limited.
おい、ここで何してる？　目障りだ、今すぐ消えろ。=Hey, what are you doing here? You're an eyesore. Now get out of here.
無駄だ。どんだけ風呂で綺麗になっても、オマエは気持ち悪いままだよ。=It's useless. No matter how clean you get in the bath, you'll still be disgusting.
なにをまごついてやがる。用が無いなら、最初からオレの視界に入るな=What are you waiting for? If you don't have something to do, stay out of my sight from the start.
なんだ？　ビビって口も聞けなくなったか？　情けねぇ。=What is it? You're so scared you can't even talk to me anymore? You're pathetic.
おっと、珍しいところで会ったな。これから風呂か？=Well, that's an unusual place to meet. Are you going to take a bath now?
オレは臭いのもそこまで嫌いじゃないが、まぁ普通は綺麗にしておいた方がいいだろうな。=I don't mind the smell, but it's usually better to keep it clean.
どうした？　何か話があるんだろう？　そんなに言い難いことか？=What's up? Is there something you want to tell me? What's so hard to say?
ったく、愚図だな。用があるならさっさと話せ。=You're a fool, aren't you? If you have something to say, just say it.
