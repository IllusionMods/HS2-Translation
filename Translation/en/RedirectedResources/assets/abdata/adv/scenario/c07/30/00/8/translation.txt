話しだけってのも、まぁまぁ楽しめたな。=I liked this little chat, but I gotta run. Catch up with you again, maybe!
退屈はしなかったな。また話してやってもいい。=It wasn't boring, at least. Of course we can chat more later.
//attitude:favor
もうこんな時間か。つい話し込んじまったな。=Oh, is it getting dark out already? Sorry man, gotta go, speak soon!
よし、そろそろ切り上げるか。話の続きはまた今度だ。=Oh, shit. I completely forgot I had things to do! I'll text you later! 
//attitude:enjoyment
話してるだけでも、結構時間が経つもんだな。それなりに楽しかったぞ。=It's so easy to get lost in those conversations, isn't it? I can't tell you how much I look forward to them.
オレと話せて嬉しかったろ？　興奮したか？=Is there something in your pocket, or do you just enjoy my company that much?
//attitude:aversion
やっと終わったか。無駄に長いだけで、どうでもいい話だったな。=Is it finally over? How can a person talk as much as you and still say nothing at all?
あぁ、時間を無駄にした。くだらねぇ話ばっかしやがって。=Yet again I've wasted my time on you when I should've known better, you're utterly hopeless.
//attitude:slavery
さて、この辺で終わりにしとかねぇとな。ずっと話し込んじまいそうだ。=Sorry, I had to cut you off there. No, nothing's wrong! I just didn't realise how late it's getting...
オマエと話すのも悪くないな。次もオレを退屈させるなよ？=I like talking to you, but sometimes you go off on those tangents and I don't know what to say.
