それで、本当に話しだけでいいのか？　身体が疼いてんじゃねぇか？=Are you sure you just want to talk? The way you're looking at me, and you're pitching a tent! Relax, I'm not calling you out! I want it too...
おい、我慢すんな。どうせ話してる間も、ムラムラしてたんだろ？=Hehe, I noticed the way you perked up when I was telling you all about my quiet weekend in bed... just what were you thinking about?
//attitude:favor
まさか、話だけで終わりってことはねぇよな？　そんなお子ちゃまじゃねぇだろ？=You're not just going to talk about it, are you? No, no, no. No more talking. Time to act.
おい、正直になれ。ずっと、オレの身体をチラチラ見てたのは分かってんだぞ？=Okay, mister. Own up! No point denying it. I saw your eyes darting between my tits and legs.
//attitude:enjoyment
今までの話は前戯みたいなもんだろ？　なら、本番をしねぇとな。=That story was meant to be its own foreplay, wasn't it? Well... it worked. No, I'm serious! Here, give me your hand. I'll let you feel how wet I am...
オマエの話に付き合ってやったんだ。次はオレに身体を貸してもらうぞ。=I went along with that, but next time just be upfront about why you're here and get straight to the point, okay?
//attitude:aversion
おい、オマエのくだらない話でストレスが溜まっちまった。解消させろ。=No offence, but your nonsense is doing my head in and stressing me out. But since you're already here, you're going to be my stress-relief exercise then you can go, okay?
やっぱ、オマエとは話すだけ無駄だな。身体だけオレに預けてりゃいいんだ。=We don't need to talk about anything. I have a job to do, and you're that job.
//attitude:slavery
待て、話より、もっとオレを簡単に満足させる方法があるだろ。それをやれ。=It's nice to chat and all, but there's easier ways to help me out. Do I have to spell it out? Fuck me. Here and now. Fuck. Me.
まさか、すんなり帰らせてもらえるとは思ってないよな？　本番はこれからだぞ？=Did you really think you'd come all the way out here to see me and I'd just let you go empty-handed? Nuh-uh, not a chance! Is anybody else around? No? Okay, good... come here...
