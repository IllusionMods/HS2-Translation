よう、背中を流しに来てやったぜ。ありがたいだろ？　ほら、もっと喜べよ。=Some places you just can't reach on your own no matter how much you try. Don't worry, hehe, I got your back. Literally! 
おっと、奇遇だな。丁度オレも、風呂で気持ちいい汗を流したいと思ってたところだ。=You're here as well? I was in the mood for a nice, long soak. Bubbles and candles. Maybe a drop of wine... but hey, I can settle for this.  
おいおい、風呂だからって隙を見せすぎだろ。そんなんだから、オレが入ってきたくなっちまうんじゃねぇか。=A tub this size shouldn't just be made for one person. Okay, my mind's made up! Scooch over, I'm getting in too!
邪魔するぞ。一人で風呂なんて、寂しいことしてんじゃねぇ。オレを誘わねぇとは、どういう了見だ？=I take it my invitation got lost in the mail, or something? Not to worry, I saw you walking around with those towels and figured you'd be here. Move over, this is my bathtime now as well.
