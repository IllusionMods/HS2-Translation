おい、本気か？　人通りが激しいなんてもんじゃねぇぞ？　つまりそういう覚悟をしなきゃいけねぇんだ。分かってんのか？=Here? Are you serious? I guess there aren't many people around, but we're still taking a risk! You understand, don't you? You're still up for it even if there's a chance we'll get caught?
まったく、オマエには恐れ入るぜ。こんな所で堂々としようなんて……オレでも考えつかなかったぞ？=Damn, dude. I have to give you props for making a move here. Even I'd have second-thoughts in case somebody walked in.
ハッ、ここでするのか？　オマエが恥をかいても、オレは知らねぇぞ？=I'm going to ride you here. I don't care if you're get embarrassed! Get with it, or get gone.
おい、オマエの粗末な姿を晒すことになるんだぞ？　一生後ろ指をさされてもいいってんなら、付き合ってやってもいい。=We'll need to work on how you carry yourself, especially if you're going to be seen with your arm around me. We'll be turning a lot of heads, you know.
おいおい、どれだけオレを楽しませてくれるんだ？　これは流石にやり過ぎな気もするが……まぁ、ビビッてちゃ何も始まらねぇよな。=It's so exciting, isn't it? Knowing what we're about to do in a place like this with no locked doors or closed curtains! I can barely contain myself, but it's up to you to make it happen.
